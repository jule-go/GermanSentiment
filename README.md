# GermanSentiment
This project is done as part of the course Corpora in Speech and Language Processing in Trinity College Dublin.
It considers the task of sentiment analysis for German. I investigate whether using a Machine Translation system is beneficial for dealing with sentiment in a low-resource scenario.
